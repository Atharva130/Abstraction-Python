# Abstraction in Python

## Introduction
Abstraction is an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concept that hides complex implementation details and shows only the necessary features to the user. It helps in reducing programming complexity and increases code readability.

## Key Concepts
- Hiding internal details and showing essential behavior  
- Achieved using abstract classes and methods  
- Promotes cleaner, modular, and extendable code  

## Topics to Learn
- Creating abstract classes using the `abc` module  
- Defining and implementing abstract methods  
- Instantiating subclasses that implement all abstract methods  
- Understanding the role of interfaces in abstraction
